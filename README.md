 PYTHON ASSIGNMENT
 Topic: Strings and Their Operations
 Instructor: CHIOKE PROMISE CHICHETARAM
 Section A – String Basics
 1. Create a string using single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes.
 Example:
 word1 = 'Hello'
 word2 = "Welcome"
 word3 = """to Python class"""
 print(word1, word2, word3)
 2. Create a variable called sentence and assign this text:
 "Python is fun to learn!"
 Then print it.
 3. Use a multiline string to store this short message and print it:
 Python is powerful.
 It is easy to learn.
 It is loved by developers.
 Section B – Strings as Arrays
 4. Create a variable text = "PYTHON"- Print the first character- Print the third character- Print the last character
 5. Create a variable language = "Python"- Loop through the string and print each letter on a new line.
 Section C – String Length and Checking
 6. Create a variable fruit = "Banana"- Print the length of the string using len()
 7. Create a variable word = "Learning Python is cool"- Check if "Python" is present in the string and print a message like:
 Yes, 'Python' is found!
 8. Using the same word, check if "Java" is not in the string and print:
 'Java' is not found in the sentence.
 Bonus Task
 9. Create a variable message = "Coding is fun"- Use a for loop to count how many times the letter "n" appears manually (without using .count())- Print the total count
 10. Write a multiline string called poem about why you like Python (at least 3 lines), and print it in
 uppercase
